## WEI Score Challenge Process

Anyone can formally challenge a published WEI score. To do so:

1. Open a GitHub Issue with label `wei-challenge`
2. Include:
   - Country or state being challenged
   - Specific indicator(s) in dispute
   - Your alternative data source (with methodology documentation)
   - Quantitative impact on the WEI score
3. The Advisory Council reviews the challenge
4. A DAO governance vote is held if the challenge has merit
5. Simple majority (51%) required to accept and revise the score
6. Challenges must be submitted within **30 days** of draft WEI publication

## Code of Conduct

SHEtoken is a project dedicated to women's empowerment. We expect all contributors to:

- Be respectful and inclusive in all communications
- Engage with data and methodology in good faith
- Declare any conflicts of interest (e.g. if you represent a government whose score you are challenging)
- Prioritise accuracy and transparency over political considerations
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

---

## Governance

Significant changes to the WEI methodology require DAO governance approval:

| Change Type | Threshold Required |
|---|---|
| Formula weights | 66% supermajority |
| New data source | 51% simple majority |
| New country or state | 51% simple majority |
| Smart contract changes | 75% supermajority + 60-day timelock |

Minor changes (documentation, bug fixes, typos) do not require governance approval.
