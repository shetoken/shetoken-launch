## Data Quality Standards

All sources must meet the following criteria to be included in WEI calculations:

```
✓ Collected by a recognised international or national statistical body
✓ Methodology publicly documented and reproducible
✓ Country/state coverage ≥ 80% of scored nations
✓ Published within the last 2 years
✓ Not self-reported by the government being scored (for Crime Penalty pillar)
✓ Available in machine-readable format (CSV, JSON, or API)
```

## Underreporting Adjustment

Crime statistics are known to significantly underreport actual prevalence. SHEtoken applies the following adjustment:

```python
def adjust_for_underreporting(reported_rate, who_survey_rate=None):
    """
    Adjust reported crime rate for known underreporting bias.
    
    Where WHO survey-based prevalence data is available,
    we use the higher of the two figures.
    
    Where no survey data is available, we apply a
    conservative 3x multiplier based on global research
    (Ellsberg et al., Lancet 2008).
    """
    if who_survey_rate:
        return max(reported_rate, who_survey_rate)
    else:
        return reported_rate * 3.0
```
